## How this is structured
This documentation is split into 2 main parts,  
    - The **Dev** section is for unlocked/development robots and aims to document how Victor and VicOS works and how to change things in it.  
    - The **User** section is for prod/locked robots and aims to provide infomation and tutorials for how to setup and do thing with your Vector. 

## Where to start

If your a user, go checkout [What's possible](user-guide/whats-possible.md) to see whats possible with your bot.
